# Get Location and GMT from Postal Code for Crestron 4 series

This is a C# library and Simpl Plus module that wraps the library to get the Lat and Long as well as GMT Offset from the postal code.   This creates signals that the astronomical clock in Crestron Simpl wants for the location to calculate sunrise and sunset.    This only works for US and Canada.



I made this because first I am lazy and tired of having to look up all this stuff for locations, and secondly have an example for programmers to see how a library can be used to look up information from an embedded resource file by leveraging reflection.
